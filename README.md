Since this system "lends" money to business operators there needs to be a REPUTATION classification and the ability to keep records of repayments that are required.  ONLY LIVING PEOPLE may have an account. No Corporations or Foundations or PERSONS of any other type than LIVING BREATING Natural Persons may participate.  A way for an account to "Will an inheritance" to another account also needs to be included.
